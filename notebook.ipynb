As a product analyst for a brick-and-mortar trainers store, I aimed to enhance revenue by analyzing various aspects of product data, including pricing, reviews, descriptions, and ratings. This analysis will inform recommendations for the marketing and sales teams to optimize strategies and drive revenue growth.\n\n### Data Sources\nFour datasets were utilized for analysis:\n- **brands.csv**: Contains information about the brand of each product, including unique product identifiers.\n- **finance.csv**: Provides financial data such as listing price, sale price, discounts, and revenue, linked by unique product identifiers.\n- **info.csv**: Includes product names, unique identifiers, and descriptions.\n- **reviews.csv**: Contains product ratings and the number of reviews, linked by unique product identifiers.\n\n### Methodology\n1. **Data Preprocessing**:\n    - Merged the datasets based on the unique product identifier.\n    - Dropped any null values to ensure data integrity.\n\n2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:\n    - Explored the distribution and characteristics of the data.\n    - Identified trends and patterns in pricing, reviews, and revenue.\n\n3. **Brand Analysis - Adidas and Nike**:\n    - Filtered products belonging to the Adidas and Nike brands for in-depth analysis.\n\n4. **Price Label Categorization**:\n    - Calculated listing price quartiles for Adidas and Nike products.\n    - Categorized products into \"Budget\", \"Average\", \"Expensive\", and \"Elite\" based on quartiles.\n\n5. **Analysis and Insights**:\n    - Grouped data by brand and price label to analyze product volume and average revenue.\n    - Derived insights to inform marketing and sales strategies for revenue improvement.\n\n\n#  brands.csv\n\n|

revenue of $2015.68.\n- **Average**: The \"Average\" category includes 655 Adidas products, generating an average revenue of $3035.30.\n- **Expensive**: Adidas offers 759 products in the \"Expensive\" category, with an average revenue of $4621.56.\n- **Elite**: Adidas has 587 products classified as \"Elite\", with an impressive average revenue of $8302.78.\n\n#### Nike Products Analysis:\n- **Budget**: Nike offers 357 products in the \"Budget\" category, with an average revenue of $1596.33.\n- **Average**: Only 8 Nike products fall into the \"Average\" category, generating an average revenue of $675.59.\n- **Expensive**: Nike has 47 products categorized as \"Expensive\", with an average revenue of $500.56.\n- **Elite**: Nike's \"Elite\" category includes 130 products, with an average revenue of $1367.45.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis provides valuable insights into the performance of Adidas and Nike products across different price categories. Both brands exhibit a similar pattern, with higher-priced products generally generating higher revenues. However, there are notable differences in the number of products and revenue across categories.\n\nFor Adidas, the \"Elite\" category stands out with a significantly higher average revenue compared to other categories. This suggests a strong demand for premium Adidas products. Meanwhile, Nike has a broader distribution of products across categories, with a relatively smaller presence in the \"Average\" category.\n\nTo capitalize on these findings, the trainers store can tailor its marketing strategies and product offerings accordingly. For instance, promoting exclusive Adidas \"Elite\" products and expanding the Nike \"Average\" product range could help capture a wider customer base and drive revenue growth. Additionally, leveraging insights on product descriptions, ratings, and reviews can further enhance customer engagement and satisfaction, ultimately contributing to long-term success in the competitive sports clothing market.\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"bb3733cf-83e1-462d-bdc7-a504dcf6ee95"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
